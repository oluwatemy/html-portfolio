<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>
  I'm thrilled to have this opportunity to introduce myself to you as both a developer and a dedicated undergraduate student at Obafemi Awolowo University, pursuing a degree in Physics. You might be wondering how these two seemingly different worlds intersect, so allow me to share my story.
</p>
<p>
  Ever since I was a kid, I've always been captivated by science especially Physics. This led me to pursue a degree in Physics as I embarked on my academic journey at Obafemi Awolowo University. Physics has always fascinated me with its fundamental principles that govern the universe. From unraveling the mysteries of subatomic particles to understanding the vastness of the cosmos. Studying physics has allowed me to cultivate analytical thinking skills and it also exposed me to the world of coding as I was required to take a course in coding which brought to life my passion for coding.
